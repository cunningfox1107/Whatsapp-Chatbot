The गिरोह GPT is a personalized AI chatbot designed to emulate the conversations, memories, and quirks of a close-knit WhatsApp group named *The गिरोह*. Built using OpenAI’s powerful GPT-4o-turbo model, it combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with document embeddings to generate context-aware, intelligent answers based on real group chats.

The project leverages LangChain,ChromaDB, and Sentence-Transformer embeddings to process and retrieve relevant chat history. A sleek, custom-designed Streamlit UI gives it a unique branded feel — with gradient backgrounds, bilingual headers (English + Devanagari), and a search-ready interface. You can ask the chatbot anything, and it responds just like a member of the गिरोह.

Additionally, it features an intelligent LinkedIn lookup module using SerpAPI, allowing the chatbot to describe group members if you ask about them.
